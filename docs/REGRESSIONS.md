the underlining of the leaderboard names shouldnt be there

or the animation of the sidebar menu has regressed i think
the colouring on the little 01-04 labels on it too
the + on the rcl sidebar menu is too big


the matches w/l ratio is broken
last active broken
the animation switching between advanced details leaderboard and simple leaderboard is gone
win rate % gone
avg score and high score values are in like a different font to the rest of the numbers??
matches count isnt accurate maybe using fallback values
us / eu filtering doesnt do anything
the seasons drop down is in reverse order now but i dont really mind that
match history corrs blocked
"home"  on the sidebar should take to retrocyclesleague.com it currently takes to the leaderboard
the subtle glow on the grandmaster names is like just  square blocks but i think i broke that myself
as you said profiles give 404
sidebar menu values on hover should be the same purpley gradient but regressed
sidebar menu button click animation only works from rcl -> close and not close -> rcl
